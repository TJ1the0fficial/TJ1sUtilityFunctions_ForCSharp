<h1> TJ1sUtilityFunctions</h1>

I made this because I thought that it would be fun to make my life easier with this.

I did not use any ai to make my code, but I did use ai to learn new stuff and to explain them to me.

<h3> Functions: </h3>
<ol>
  <li>-print (Prints out anything to the console, just like in Python)</li>
  <li>-input (Works the same way like in Python)</li>
</ol>
