<h1> TJ1sUtilityFunctions</h1>

I made this because I thought that it would be fun to make my life easier with this.

I did not use any ai to make my code, but I did use ai to learn new stuff and to explain them to me.

<h3> Functions: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>print (Prints out anything to the console, just like in Python)</li>
  <li>input (Works the same way like in Python)</li>
  <li>list_arrays_children (prints out the array's children in a formatted version) </li>
  <li>list_arrays_children_with_type (you need to give type as a parameter, then an array,
    it has type of ways to present the array's children <ul>
      <li>Normal (It is the same as the list_arrays_children)</li>
      <li>Ordered (It prints put the children with the index to tell you where it takes place)</li>
    </ul>)</li>
</ul>
